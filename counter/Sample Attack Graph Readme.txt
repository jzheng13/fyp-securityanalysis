Note:

1. Redundant nodes still present.
2. The default account represents a null account. For instance, accessing an apple 
   account by password recovery only requires answers to the security questions as
   as well as the username. The default account is hence introduced as a null account 
   that the attacker always has access to.
3. Coloured edges added, but adding frequency of connections still in progress.
